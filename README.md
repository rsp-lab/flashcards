# Flashcards

![Flashcards Image](/flashcards-image.png?raw=false)

A flashcard-style tool for learning text-based elements. 
It can be used for language learning, e.g. the front side of the flashcard contains a word in the native language, while the back side provides the corresponding word in a foreign language.
It allows creating a test from randomly selected flashcards.
My motivation was to develop an application that would enhance my process of learning English vocabulary.
Implemented in Java, Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf.

### Usage

Run in target directory:
> java -jar flashcards-1.0.jar
